## 1. 📌 Overview

Ideon is a **portfolio and connection-only platform** designed to showcase our completed projects and enable interested students or clients to connect with us.

The platform **does not deliver projects directly through the system**. Instead, Ideon acts as a professional display of our work, credibility, and expertise. All project delivery, customization, pricing, and execution happen **outside the platform through direct communication channels**.

Ideon’s primary role is to:
- Display real, deployed projects
- Build trust through transparency
- Enable meaningful connections

## 4. 🧩 Problem Statement

Many college students lack the technical expertise, time, or guidance to convert ideas into fully working projects. Existing platforms provide either theoretical ideas or copied code without deployment or explanation. Ideon bridges this gap by delivering end-to-end project solutions with real-world usability.
